<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p class="float"><img src="images/Ooka.jpg" width ="140" alt="Self Photo">I am a research scientist located at RIKEN, Japan. My main research goal is to formulate a theory which can predict the behavior of chemical reaction networks. </p>
		
	<p> Chemical reactions are happening all around us. The air that we breathe and the food that we eat is used to produce the energy and molecules necessary for us in a process called metabolism. As metabolism is a network composed over 1000 chemical reactions, this is a prime example of a chemical reaction network. Catalysis is another example of a chemical reaction network, and the efficiency of an overall reaction (for example, making hydrogen from water) is determined by how multiple chemical processes interact. On a much larger scale, the carbon balance in our atmosphere is also a chemical reaction network, and includes reactions such as combustion (CO<sub>2</sub> formation) and photosynthesis (CO<sub>2</sub> consumption).</p>

	<p>If we can predict how a chemical reaction network will behave, it will help us solve important challenges facing society today. The two topics of my research now is (1) How can we design a good catalyst? and (2) What are the rules behind the efficiency of chemical reaction networks in biology? My endeavor to answer these questions has lead me to learn new techniques. Although I started out as an experimental spectroelectrochemist, I have also self-taught myself the basics of chemical reaction network theory, machine learning, and numerical simulations using Python, as well as some of the mathematical concepts necessary to understand complexity and chaos. I am always eager to learn something new, and I believe that the freedom to do so is one of the great joys of being a scientist. </p>
