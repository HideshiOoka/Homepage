	<h3>Importance of Learning to Code (Even for Experimentalists)</h3>
	<p>Nowadays, writing documents using Microsoft Word and handling tables using Excel is not a special skill. I believe that coding and being able to use the command line interface is going to be a similar "universal" skill, and that everyone would benefit from learning it. Why? because we are generating more data than ever before, and it is impossible to handle large volumes of data without some kind of automation. For people interested in theoretical research (numerical simulations, bioinformatics and data mining), this should be obvious. Even if coding is not directly connected to your day-to-day research, here are some examples of how coding and automation can improve your productivity.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Data conversion, for example converting your publication list to between various formats like Word, HTML</li>
		<li> Sorting your directory, such as searching and deleting duplicate files</li>

	</ul>
