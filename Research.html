	<h2 id="Catalysis Theory">Catalysis Theory</h2>
		<p> The Sabatier principle is at the core of our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. Originally proposed around 1911 by the French chemist Paul Sabatier, this principle states that a good catalyst must bind the reactant at a strength which is "just right". If the binding is too weak, there is insufficient interaction to promote the reaction, whereas if the interaction is too strong, the reactant cannot desorb from the catalyst, leading to low amounts of the final product. Although this principle was originally an empirical one, the advancement of DFT and other <i>in-silico</i> techniques have allowed the Sabatier principle to be used as a quantitative basis to search for new catalysts. Many recent studies using machine learning and neural networks are also using the Sabatier principle as the conceptual basis for materials screening.</p>
		
		<p> However, the Sabatier principle is thermodynamic in nature, and cannot predict how fast a reaction will occur. Instead, the binding energy and the corresponding thermodynamic landscape are used to estimate the true activity (rate laws). For this reason, a conceptual expansion is necessary to truly predict and rationalize the behavior of catalysts under real, non-equilibrium conditions. Currently, I am collaborating with experimentalists to expand the theory of electrocatalysis. </p>
		
		<p>So far, I have shown that the optimum binding energy can shift at higher rates of catalysis mathematically (2019 <i>JPCL</i>) and have shown experimentally that Pt, which is one of the best catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, can be understood within this framework (2021 <i>ACS Catal.</i>). I have also modelled the nitrite reduction reaction on molybdenum sulfide based on a proposed reaction mechanism and have shown that it is consistent with experiments (2022 <i>Nat. Catal.</i>).</p>

		<p> The enzymes which are responsible for catalyzing the biochemical reactions in metabolism are also catalysts, suggesting that the theoretical findings and methods outlined above for artificial cataylsis should also be applicable to biocatalysis. Notable examples include the Sabatier principle and the Bronsted (Bell)-Evans-Polanyi relationship. Based on these fundamental concepts, I am currently trying to develop a general design principle for enzymes. In addition to making predictions, I am also performing bioinformatic analyses and working with experimental biologists to verifying the applicability of the predictions. Once the behavior of each enzyme can be rationalized in relation to physicochemical parameters, I am aiming to expand the analysis from single enzymes to a network, which may lead to a general design principle of biological metabolism. </p>
