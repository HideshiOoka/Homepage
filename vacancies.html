    <!-- PAGE SPECIFICS -->
	<h2>Open Positions</h2>
		<p>I am eager to work with postdoc, technical staff, part-time workers, and PhD candidates with the skills and motivation to understand and regulate the kinetics of catalytic reactions. I believe theoretical predictions should go hand in hand with experimental verification, thus candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds are welcome, such as (but not limited to) electrocatalysis, product analysis (HPLC/GCMS), theoretical simulations (DFT, MD, or microkinetics), machine learning, applied mathematics (chemical reaction network theory, graph theory), and bioinformatics.</p>

		<p>At the moment of writing (Dec. 2025), no positions are open now, but people interested in joining me after April 1st, 2026 are welcome to contact me <a href="contact.html">here</a>. English will be the main langauge for scientific communication within our group. More details on mentoring policy and expectations can be found <a href="https://www.notion.so/Information-for-Prospective-Members-288eaa0432788052ab98ff24898e54ae?source=copy_link">here</a>. Due to funding limitations, people interested in working with me are expected to apply for some kind of scholarship program, such as those listed below.</p2>	

	<h3>For Postdocs</h3>
		<p>The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) is the biggest funder for postdoc scholarships in Japan. The details can be found <a href = "https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/">here</a>. This program is quite competitive, but are typically considered to be among the best postdoc positions in Japan in terms of financial support and prestige. Applications are due in mid-April or May each year. Another call usually becomes open around August for people coming from outside Japan.</p>

	<h3>For PhD Candidates / Undergraduates</h3>	
		<p>Please contact me directly for details.</p>

	<h3>For Technical Staff / Part-time Workers</h3>	
		<p>I am currently looking for members with either experimental or theoretical skills. Please contact me for details.</p>
