	<h2>For Students</h2>
	<h3>Importance of Learning to Code (Even for Experimentalists)</h3>
	<p>Nowadays, writing documents using Microsoft Word and handling tables using Excel is not a special skill. Most people would agree that these tools are worth learning, because it increases productivity compared to earlier alternatives, such as pen and paper or the calculator. I think coding and being somewhat familiar with the command line interface is also a similar "universal" skill, and that everyone would benefit from learning it. Why? Because it is virtually impossible to handle large volumes of data without some kind of automation. Would you like to add or subtract 100 numbers using the calculator? Probably not. It is slow, boring, and error prone. However, if you knew the "sum" function in Excel, it would only take several seconds. Even though Excel functions aren't really considered "programming", they still showcase how automation and programming tools help make data conversion and data analysis easier. Even if coding is not directly connected to your day-to-day research, here are some examples of how coding and automation can improve your productivity.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Data conversion, for example converting your publication list to between various formats like Word, HTML</li>
		<li> Sorting your directory, such as searching and deleting duplicate files. Helpful especially if you are like me and have a tendency to download the same file multiple times.</li>
		<li> For electrochemists, conversion between Ag/AgCl, SHE, and RHE</li>
		<li> Analyzing spectra, for example subtraction, overlay, fitting</li>
		<li> Writing repetive code. For example, navigation bars of websites often require similar text to be pasted across multiple pages. Pasting it once might be OK, but as soon as you want to edit the navigation bar, you need to change every single file. The navigation bar of this very homepage was generated using Python.</li>
	</ul>
	As a side note, many coding tools like Python, Javascript, and Latex are open source, meaning you won't have to buy expensive software again.

	<h3>How to Write Papers</h3>
	<p>Writing papers is hard. You are expected to explain how your work is important and original, but it has to be done based on some kind of scientific evidence. Often, it takes years of practice to find the right balance. I recommend this <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.7b00566>editorial</a> in ACS Catalysis about the general mindset when writing your paper.</p>

	<h3>Tutorials</h3>
	<p>Nowadays, there is so much information on the internet that learning anything is possible if you have enough time and dedication. On top of that, much of the information, like Youtube lectures, are free. Here are several tutorials, textbooks, and lectures that I have found easy to understand and extremely well organized. I would recommend these to anyone wanting to study the relevant topic.</p>
